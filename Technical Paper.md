# Technical Paper
### Situation: You joined a new project. The project is going through some performance and scaling issues. After some analysis, the team lead asks you to investigate possibly using a NoSQL database will improve performance.

## Abstract
NoSQL databases are a type of database that does not use the traditional relational database model. NoSQL databases are often used for applications that require high performance, scalability, and flexibility.
This paper discusses the different types of NoSQL databases and why they are used. It also provides an overview of the benefits and challenges of using NoSQL databases.

## Introduction
When people use the term “NoSQL database”, they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non-SQL” while others say it stands for “not only SQL”. Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.

## Benefits of No-SQL databases
1. Flexible Data Models:
Unlike SQL tables, these do not mandate a predefined schema. This means that documents within a single collection can possess varying sets of fields, and the data type for a specific field can vary from one document to another within the same collection.
2. Horizontal Scaling:
Unlike many SQL databases that necessitate vertical scaling when resource capacity is exceeded, NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling. This approach permits the seamless addition of economical commodity servers to meet growing demands.
3. Expedited Queries:
In contrast to SQL databases, where data is often normalized, necessitating complex joins for retrieving a single entity's information, NoSQL databases optimize data storage for efficient querying. This optimization eliminates the need for complex joins, resulting in exceptionally fast query execution.
4. Developer-Friendly:
Certain NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, align their data structures with popular programming languages. This alignment simplifies data storage, mirroring the way developers handle data in their application code. This harmonious mapping reduces the need for extensive coding, expediting development and reducing the likelihood of bugs.
