# Tiny Habits

### Question 1
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

### Answer 1
The most interesting idea in this video is the concept of "Tiny Habits" as a method for behaviour change. Dr Fogg's approach of starting with extremely small and achievable habits and connecting them to existing behaviours or "anchors" is a practical and effective way to make lasting changes

### Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

### Answer 2
BJ Fogg's B = MAP formula for habit formation consists of:
- B (Behavior): The habit you want to form.
- M (Motivation): Your desire and willingness to perform the habit.
- A (Ability): How easy or difficult it is to perform the habit.
- P (Prompt): The cue or reminder to initiate the habit.
To make forming new habits easier, align your motivation and ability, use effective prompts, and start with very small, manageable steps for your habits. This approach maximizes your chances of habit success.

### Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

### Answer 3
Celebrating after each successful habit completion boosts motivation, reinforcing the behaviour and making it more likely to stick. It builds a sense of accomplishment, turning the habit into a rewarding and natural part of your routine.

### Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

### Answer 4

This practical strategy can significantly improve your ability to build good habits by specifying when, where, and how you'll implement them.

### Question 5
What is the book's perspective about Identity?
### Answer 5
The book "Atomic Habits" emphasizes the importance of identity in habit formation. It suggests that adopting an identity aligned with your desired habits is a powerful way to drive behavior change effectively. Focusing on becoming the type of person who has those habits is a key perspective in the book.

### Question 6
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

### Answer 6
The book "Atomic Habits" provides the perspective that making a habit easier to do involves reducing friction and increasing convenience. To achieve this, one should design their environment to minimize obstacles and enhance cues for the desired habit. Simplifying the initial steps and incorporating immediate rewards or satisfaction can also make a habit easier to adopt and maintain.

### Question 7
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

### Answer 7
The book "Atomic Habits" suggests that making a habit harder to do involves increasing friction and adding obstacles. You can achieve this by redesigning your environment to create barriers to the habit, making it less attractive, and removing cues that trigger the habit.
